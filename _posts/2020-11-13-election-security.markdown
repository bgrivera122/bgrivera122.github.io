# Election Security


Despite there being no evidence to the 2020 elections being subject to fraud, there is a common sentiment across right-leaning groups that suggest the exact opposite. It's important to understand how the elections were not rigged, and the technology behind keeping it secured falls.
<br>
When I walked into the polling location this year, I was surprised at the upgrades that were in place compared to the 2016 election, and even more so from the 2012 election. The 2012 election was all done through paper ballots from the home of a neighbor that lived down the street from me. The 2016 polling place was done though paper as well, but with an elaborate inking and card system. But this year, there were long tablets with touch-reliant commands. These commands would be printed out on a paper ballot cleanly, and shown to me before I confirmed my choice.
<br>
This year, I thought to myself, "Why not just move toward online voting," or just allow me to use my cellphone since a personal phone is a secure device. What I thought about afterwards was a verifyable paper trail. A paper trail must always be present, and a paper trail means that fraud can be proven as there would need to be a physical presentation of re-marked ballots.

It is in this situation where the integrity of our electronic voting systems need to be upheld. Outside of potential mechanical failures, the nature of voting being unconnected to the internet and having information imbedded into the screens goes a long way to ward off fraud. It is also a fascinating logistical challenge, one that we should be ready to handle in 2024.
