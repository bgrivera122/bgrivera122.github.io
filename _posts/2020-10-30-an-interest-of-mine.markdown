# An Interest of Mine
## Tech and Clientelle

I am fortunate to have employment, but especially so in an occupation that is both personally enjoyable an fulfilling. I am a repair technician at a local repair shop, and fix common issues and deal with the wide variety of clients that come into the store.

 This will be relevant to my future, as I will be entering a helpdesk position soon as a start to my career in IT. Dealing with physical hardware and having the skills to understand what a client needs and wants are skills that will be carrying over into my near future.

## Clients vs. Themselves

One thing that has happened repeatedly and needed to be identified quickly in order to be efficient is to identify when a client's knowledge on the situation ends and where assumptions begin. It is not uncommon for a client to give misinformation regarding what is not functioning. It's important to remember to understand what the missing function is, not the specific error itself when listening to a client. For example, a client thinks their pictures are missing from their computer, but they're located on a cloud service.

## Opening The Insides

When you have a clue as to what to do, you still need to be able to perform the task itself. Advanced repairs are more involved than replacing a hard drive or swapping RAM sticks; The fun in being a technician is slowly accumulating over time the many differences between brands, styles, and technical know-how to replace and repair these parts. I am currently learning how to solder, so that motherboard repairs are possible. It is a very exciting prospect to continue down the path toward hardware repairs, it being a confidence booster and a big relief to the people in our community.

## What's Next

I understand that I may not always work on laptops and face customers, but it's a strong springboard that I'm taking advantage of. Hopefully a future in a corporate helpdesk setting will provide me with as much fulfillment as my current job, and be able to use the skills I have today in future scenarios.
