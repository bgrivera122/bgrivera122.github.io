# My Experience with Udemy

Udemy has been a significant help and a treasure trove of information and training. I had first heard of Udemy in 2018 from a classmate I had worked on projects with. Covering a wide assortment of subjects with vidoes that are far superior quality that could be found on YouTube, Udemy courses often include materials that better help me understand what's going on.

For example, I'm working on Stephane Maarek's AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner course. I am still early on in the course, but I'm learning about the EC2 Image Builder and how to automate the creation of VM's or container images. It's comforting to know that there are alternate approaches to automation even if it's outside the scope of this class; This doesn't cover Terraform but being introduced to different services is never a bad thing.

In addition to AWS services, a personal interest is to pursue the CompTIA Network+ certification. Mike Myers' Network+ Certification course is pleasantly easy to follow and helps me understand subnets beyond just using an online calculator to not botch CIDR blocks for the VPC.

I will be getting more in-depth with my next blog post with Project 1's Terraform file. Currently, it is incomplete but the blog is a good medium to go into analyzing the anatomy of it.
