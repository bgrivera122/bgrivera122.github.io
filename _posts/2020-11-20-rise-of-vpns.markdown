# Rise of VPN's

Virtual Private Networks (VPN's) have always been around, but with the sudden presence of NordVPN and ExpressVPN advertisements on YouTube and my workplace employing a VPN for a workbench computer, I was wondering if that was indicative of a trend I wasn't aware of. Turns out, it was increasing in popularity.
<br>
It turns out that VPN's have exploded in popularity since 2017 and is still trending upward. In 2010, a tiny fraction of a percent of network endpoints came from a VPN, but by 2020 there was over a 3000% increase to 4.65% of endpoints using a VPN. In 2016, the VPN market was $15 billion. In just 2 years, it had grown 25% to $20.6 billion. Go Globe estimates that the market will grow to be $35 billion by 2022.
<br>
VPN's have entered the mainstream not just because they enhance security, but they've been seen as a method to bypass region-locked streaming content, enhance their social media and news experiences, enable privacy for content sharing. Security breaches are hitting mainstream media, and modern VPN's being enabled in a single click are very enticing for users to not just be proactive, but to be more informed regarding how their personal data is being harvested,tracked, and sold.
<br>
I myself use NordVPN to avoid having suggestion and recommendation functions on websites track me. However convenient they may be, I do not like the idea of being readily identified in a sea of information. I do not feel there is an immediate threat to us that goes beyond greed, but when our information is being stored en masse, the possibility for abuse of it in the future is something that cannot be ignored.
