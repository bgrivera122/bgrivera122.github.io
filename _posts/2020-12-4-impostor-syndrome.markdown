# Impostor Syndrome

## What is it?
<br>
Impostor syndrome is when someone doubts their abilities in their chosen field. This can be very valid, where an individual needs to dedicate more time towards their skill set, to invalid where the victim of imposterism is capable or exceeds the required criteria to be proficient in their field.
<br>
## How does it affect me?
<br>
In a significant way, I feel incapable of excelling in real-world IT scenarios. This stems from witnessing my peers quickly navigating their way around materials in a natural way, at times treaing the classwork as trivial. I myself struggle until I reach a certain threshold, and hindsight tells me that I shouldn't have had such an issue in the first place. A good example for this was the Dockerfile: Having never used Docker, I was frightened until I started working on it and seeing how it was not unlike scripts I have seen in earlier classes.

<br>

When I work on assignments, I feel genuinely happy and that's what encourages me to continue. I was originally an English major, and realized I was not remotely challenged. Being in these classes now, it's the opposite effect. But trying to be positive only helps when I have some sort of structure to lean on, like classes. When/if I gruaduate, I'm not sure how I'll manage to hang with my peers that enter these situations as enthusiasts, unlike myself.

## Staying Positive
<br>
Most of what I have learned in school has been through Udemy.com, on-campus tutoring, and a mentor-coworker that has worked at a game development studio in the recent past. When I spend time on Udemy.com, it has turned less into, "Am I studying the right thing at all," and turned more into "this will be useful someday." I try to lean on my enjoyment of learning the material closest to what I'll be using versus panicing. I have my bad days, but the good days are becoming more frequent and that helps me stay in things until I succeed.
