# The H-1B Visa: Not So Straightforward

## H-1B Today

America’s workforce has become more diverse over the years. Today, immigrants make up one out of every five Information Technology specialists and one of every six persons in engineering. (Department of Labor Statistics) Many technology  companies today are experiencing a critical talent shortage of IT and other professionals, making the recruitment of a multinational workforce a priority. One of the primary methods employed today in order to fill that need is using something known as the H-1B visa program.

First implemented in 1990 as part as part of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the U.S. allows a total of 85,000 applicants to enter the country under the visa each year, with 20,000 of the visas reserved for applicants who hold at a master’s degree or an equivalent. Most applicants need to hold a bachelor’s degree or equivalent to be considered for the visa.

Today, an estimate of 460,000 H-1B workers reside in the U.S. Introduced to fill high-demand jobs, half of today’s visas are given to applicants who work in the tech field, for tech companies such as Google and Microsoft.

H-1B visas are issued through an application-based lottery every year. Unfortunately, large, mostly Indian-based IT service firms (ITSF's) receive the majority of the visas due to their specialized nature and dedication to expediting and gaming paperwork to increase the chances of being selected. Among the most-recognized companies that contract H-1B visa holders to employers in the U.S. are HCL Technologies, Tata, and east coast-based Cognizant Technology Solutions.

## The Problems With H-1B

The primary issue with ITSF firms taking a significant portion of the H-1B visas is that they’re being used to replace domestic labor for the benefit of the employer’s desire to reduce labor costs. The purpose of the visa was to compensate for skilled labor shortages, but is instead displacing domestic workers at the same education level. Because of the high volume of foreign workers, this practice is creating a trend where U.S.-based students are being dissuaded from entering the field, (Rothwell) and leading to a situation where employers can be left dependant on the visa for labor.

Certain outsourcing firms flood the lottery systems with applications; their focus on filing governmental paperwork mean that these companies receive disproportionate amounts of visas as opposed to smaller companies that require H-1B workers out of necessity. New Jersey-based Cognizant Technology Solutions received 9,281 visas, and Tata received 7,454 visas in 2013. In the same year, Facebook received only 307.

## Wage and Age Gaps

All H-1B visa recipients are required to be paid the “prevailing wage (shown in Table 4 as “Claimed Wage”),” the legally defined amount of money that reflects the economic trend of the occupations the workers are entering. However, this can be bypassed by changing the job title to that of a lower-paying position, or setting an inflexible salary that does not reflect the immigrant’s premium skills for the jobs in the IT field (cloud computing, Linux development, Win32 familiarity) or reflect on the geographical economic trend of the area or city. (Matloff)

The tactics employed by ITSF firms are also displacing older Americans who have difficulties re-acquiring work.

In 2015, the Southern California Edison (SCE) and Disney found themselves on news headlines (Harrison) due to accusations that both companies fired and replaced their IT specialists and staff with foreign workers holding the H-1B visa. Despite receiving poor publicity, Disney and SCE were within legal rights to replace workers and take advantage of its economical feasibility. The fired domestic workers were above the age of 40, while H-1B sponsored immigrants are typically under the age of 30.

The tech industry claims that older domestic workers are harder to employ, as their skillsets are outdated and do not know modern languages like Python or C#. However, the reality is that in the vast majority of cases, the senior employees are ordered to train the foreign workers and bestow knowledge that can only be gained through experience before the visa holders replace them. It is the foreign workers who lack the experience, and the rapid nature of “knowledge transferring” quickly results in a lower quality of standard for workplaces that are reliant on H-1B workers. (Miano)

## Institutionalized Transgressions

Another unfortunate abuse of the H-1B visa program is that the foreign workers who are arriving from their countries are limited in their ability to defend themselves from ethics and rights violations. Workers are often pressured to perform extra duties without extra pay but rendering them unable to leave or switch their location of employment. The companies that accept the workers from ITSF firms are the only companies that can employ them or sponsor the potential for a green card visa. H-1B worker’s statuses are exploited because of their lack of mobility. They are often placed in unfair or harsh conditions, and do not have bargaining power

## The Future Just Hit Us

With the president-elect being all but confirmed at the time of this blog post, I have noticed a sudden trend raising awareness of the H-1B visa. Immigration is a core component of what gives America it's identity, and having unquestioned H-1B abuse go forward and having it be billed by it's proponents as an all-positive tool is something that must be informed against.
